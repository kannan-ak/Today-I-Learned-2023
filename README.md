#### Happy Tamil New Year!
- For the last 2 days, I've been learning basic web development in GoLang.
- Learned how to setup a web server, using Handlerfunc, how to do routing based on the paths
- Today I practised how to send a custom status code, error messages

#### All it took is missing a couple of days of updates and then 2 months are gone. Reminder to myself to keep the momentum going.
- For the first time, I actually went through the github repo of an OSS project. Cloned the repo and build it manually. Learned what are npm, yarn - package managers. Also how to test locally. 
So for any OSS contribution, you follow the developer guide, make changes locally, test it.
This feels like a huge step forward for me, next is to find interesting projects in GO with beginner-friendly issues and raise a PR by April
